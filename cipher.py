"""
Program execution
1. Main loads text and options
2. Load the layout
3. Generate possible choices for each character
4. Choose which choice(s) to display
5. Print output to stdout

Programming plan
1. Write layout loader
2. Cipher text
3. Implement all the command-line options

Validation checks
* Each character appears only once in the layout file
* (Characters in the input that are not in the layout are skipped)
* Optional: ensure that each letter appears once in the layout (no skipped letters)
