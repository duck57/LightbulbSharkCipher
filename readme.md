# The Shark Cipher

## Using the Cipher

The operation of this cipher is outlined in Letter #111 from the First Eric
Sanderson (presented on pages 73--76 of _The Raw Shark Texts_ by Steven Hall).
A major implication of these instructions is that the process to encode a
message is identical to the process used to decode ciphertext: the difference
lies in how you go from your list of possibilities of each character to the
final output.

## Using this program

### System Requirements

Python 3.? with Click installed

### Command Options

TK: explain the command-line options once available

The example input phrase is `What you are refering to as Linux`.

#### TK layout

Default QWERTY

#### TK Length (1 vs 8)

Default 8

#### TK Direction (positive, negative, random, static)

Default random

#### TK starting block (0-7, ignored for random)

N/A default

#### TK skips (1 or 3 [5 or 7 are equivalent to 1 or 3 in the opposite direction])

N/A default

### Decoding

TK show example of ciphered text containing the original message

## Ideas for Extension

These are ideas that you, the user, are free to run with.  I currently lack the
interest to see these projects through to completion but they would be valuable
additions towards the use of this tool for cracking these ciphers.

* Automate using a dictionary to find words in a ciphered text
* An interactive tool to use a dictionary to find words from ciphertext
