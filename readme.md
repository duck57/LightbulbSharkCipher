# The Shark Cipher

## Using the Cipher

The operation of this cipher is outlined in Letter #111 from the First Eric
Sanderson (presented on pages 73--76 of _The Raw Shark Texts_ by Steven Hall).
A major implication of these instructions is that the process to encode a
message is identical to the process used to decode ciphertext: the difference
lies in how you go from your list of possibilities of each character to the
final output.
